# Development Wiki

This Obsidian vault serves as a structured, scalable documentation system for product, architecture, operations, and agile team processes.

## âœ… Whatâ€™s Inside

- `DEVELOPMENT_WIKI/` â€“ The primary documentation space
  - **00_Product** â€“ Feature specs, backlog items, and roadmap entries
  - **01_Architecture** â€“ Decision records, diagrams, and module design
  - **02_Release Notes** â€“ Deployment changelogs and release history
  - **03_Operations** â€“ CI/CD, monitoring, readiness, infrastructure
  - **04_â€“ 06_** â€“ Working Sessions, meetings, Scrum foundations
  - **07_â€“ 08_** â€“ Knowledge base and business questions

- `Development Wiki Templates/` â€“ Pre-built templates for every documentation category
  - Dynamically indexed using Dataview
  - Templater-ready with metadata support

## ðŸ”§ Usage

- All indexes are auto-generated using [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and styled with collapsible callouts or card layouts.
- Templates use Templater syntax for reusable notes.
- Folder prefixes (`00_`, `01_`, etc.) are used for navigation order.
